# MachineLearningProjects

This will be my repo for my machine learning projects and my own notes/thoughts while doing them

Sept 3rd 2025:
Started the repo and started on a lung cancer ml to predict if a patient has cancer based on their history
Finished data encoding and started basic data visualization (heat map only)
next step:
complete data visualization
