# MachineLearningProjects

This will be my repo for my machine learning projects and my own notes/thoughts while doing them

Sept 3rd 2025:
Started the repo and started on a lung cancer ml to predict if a patient has cancer based on their history
Finished data encoding and started basic data visualization (heat map only)
 Sept 4th 2025:
 Standrized the values and started the KNN model

next step:
try and improve the knn model and try other models
